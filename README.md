# Streamystats

Streamystats is a statistics service for Jellyfin, providing analytics and data visualization. 📈 Built with modern advanced frameworks.

> ⚠️ This is a hobby project of mine. Don't expect fast development.

## ✨ Features

- 🖥️ Dashboard with overview statistics, live sessions and more!
- 👤 User-specific watch history and statistics
- 🌟 Most popular item tracking
- 📚 Library statistics
- ⏱️ Watch time graphs with advanced filtering
- 🏠 Multi-server and user support
- 🔄 Full sync options of items, libraries and users from the settings page

## Roadmap

- [x] Personal statistics only visible to that user
- [x] Remove the use of the playback reporting plugin
- [ ] Only sync certain libraries
- [ ] Individual item statistics
- [ ] More statistics about unwatched items and maybe the possibility to remove old or unwatched items
- [ ] More granular sync options

## 🚀 Getting started

> Playback reporting plugin is no longer needed and Streamystats soely relies on the Jellyfin API for statistics.

1. Install Docker and Docker Compose if you haven't already.
2. Copy the `docker-compose.yml` file to your desired location. Use tag `:edge`.
3. Change any ports if needed. Default web port is `3000`.
4. Change the `SECRET_KEY_BASE` in the `docker-compose.yml` file to a random string. You can generate one with `openssl rand -hex 64`.
5. Start the application with `docker-compose up -d`
6. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
7. Follow the setup wizard to connect your Jellyfin server.

First time load can take a while, depending on the size of your library.
